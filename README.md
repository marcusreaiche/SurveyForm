# freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Projects

##  &#8545; - Build a Survey Form

See the Project specification at [freeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form).


### Technology Stack:

* To complete this project we used plain vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Remarks:

* By filling out this form, we can provide estimates of your _BMI_, _BMR_, and your _daily calorie intake necessity_.
* It is not necessary to press the _submit_ button to see your results.
* The _submit_ button does not send your data anywhere. This is just a _fake_ registration website.
